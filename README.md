# PythonMinecraftGames

You can play games in this repository on Minecraft Pi or on Minecraft PC using the RaspberryJam Forge mod or on a Spigot server with the RaspberryJuice (e.g. https://github.com/daveboden/raspberryjuice).

# Games

## Hide N Seek

hidenseek.py gets the player to use the Debug F3 screen block coordinates to try and find and mine a hidden diamond block.
First get the X (East / West) and Z (North / South) coordinates right then look down and get the Y-coordinate sorted out to find the block.
